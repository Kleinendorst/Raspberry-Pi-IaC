# There appears to be a problem when starting up the Postgres container,
# see: https://github.com/immich-app/immich/issues/19038. A workaround is discussed which involves
# downgrading the postgres container. I downgraded it manually (which means rerunning the role will break it).
# According to the issue mentioned above it should be fixed quite quickly though so next time it is worth a shot
# to see if it's fixed.

# Public access is provided by using a CloudFlare zero trust tunnel.
# I however found out that the free tier has a maximum file size upload of 100 Mb which
# can be too small for some videos that might be uploaded.
# So in addition to the Cloudflare tunnel it is also exposed the service via
# Locally on the network (with a 5 GiB upload size limit): local.immich.kleinendorst.info
# This can actually be configured to be used on the WiFi network in the app.
